 Kaggle CoIL 2000 Challenge

In conjunction with assessment of FIT5149 - Applied Data Analysis based on Kaggle CoIL 2000 Challenge where one is provided with 10000 customer records with 86 attributes and is required to predict who would be interested in buying a caravan insurance policy based on socio-demographic and product ownership.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and studied correlation between attributes to identify potential relationships that can impact the target variable (whether the customer will purchase caravan insurance or not).

Carried out feature selection on the 85 feature attributes with Forward and Backward Stepwise Selection and Lasso Regularisation using R leaps and glmnet libraries.

Developed machine learning classification algorithms with Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis using R glmnet and MASS libraries.

Implemented k-fold cross-validation, ROC curve and confusion matrix using R cvtools, caret and pROC libraries to study the best algorithm for the prediction task.

Scored High Distinction for the clear descriptive analysis in the whole prediction task and was chosen by the academic teaching team as one of the best submission out of the 200+ cohort, and was used as the model answer for the following semester teaching cohort
